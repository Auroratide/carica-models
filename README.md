# Carica Models by Auroratide

These are various hairstyles and expressions that can be used with the **[Carica](https://github.com/Auroratide/carica)** library.

```html
<carica-character>
    <carica-head>
        <carica-hair src="https://unpkg.com/@auroratide/carica-models/models/hair/medium.svg"></carica-hair>
    </carica-head>
</carica-character>
```

There are very few things right now, and this library currently mostly exists for testing.

To come:

* Many more models
* A way to visualize models and see adjustable parameters
* Consolidation of files into a single library file
